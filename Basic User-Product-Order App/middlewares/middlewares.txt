🔄 What is a Middleware in Express?
A middleware is a function in Express that runs between the request and the response. It can:

Modify the req or res objects

End the request-response cycle

Or pass control to the next middleware using next()

🧩 Syntax:
js
Copy
Edit
(req, res, next) => {
  // your code
  next(); // call the next middleware or route
}
🔧 Example:
js
Copy
Edit
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // continue to next
};

app.use(logger); // applies to every request
📌 Common Uses of Middleware:
Logging requests

Validating data (like using Joi)

Authentication

Error handling

Serving static files

Parsing request bodies (e.g. express.json())

🔁 How it Works in a Route:
js
Copy
Edit
app.get("/profile", authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send("Your profile");
});
authMiddleware runs first

If user is valid, it calls next()

Then your /profile route runs

Would you like me to show a real middleware flow with console.log() to see how next() works in action?
